# Architecture Evaluation Tool

## One-liner Description
A tool for architecture evaluation using evolution theory matrix to help software architects, students, and researchers follow structured design approaches like Attribute-Driven Design (ADD).

## Project Goal(s)
To create a tool that helps architects evaluate software architectures by:
- Representing architectures using an evolution theory matrix (non-functional requirements as rows, components as columns)
- Supporting component specifications in PlantUML format
- Enabling version comparison with PlantUML diff visualization
- Facilitating structured architecture evaluation following established methodologies

## Threshold of Success
The tool successfully enables users to:
1. Define and visualize architectures using the evolution theory matrix
2. Specify components in PlantUML format
3. Compare different architecture versions and see diffs in PlantUML
4. Evaluate architectures against non-functional requirements systematically

## Description
Architecture evaluation is a critical aspect of software design, with established methodologies like Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) providing structured approaches. However, practitioners lack tools to systematically apply these methods.

This tool addresses this gap by providing:
- A matrix-based visualization where rows represent non-functional requirements (NFRs) and columns represent architectural components
- Support for PlantUML component specifications
- Version comparison capabilities to track architecture evolution
- A local deployment solution for students, researchers, and software architects

## Project Context Diagram

TODO: Add project context diagram

**Stakeholders:**
- **Students**: Learners taking architecture courses who need tools to practice structured design
- **Researchers**: Academics studying software architecture methodologies
- **Software Architects**: Practitioners who need systematic approaches to evaluate designs

**External Systems:**
- **PlantUML**: Standard format for component specifications
- **ADD Methodology**: Attribute-Driven Design framework (reference approach)
