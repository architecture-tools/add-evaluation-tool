# Functional Requirements

## Core Analysis & Evaluation

- **FR1**: Parse PlantUML diagrams to extract architectural components and relationships
- **FR2**: Maintain a predefined set of non-functional requirements (NFRs) for evaluation
- **FR3**: Generate evaluation matrices linking architectural components to NFRs
- **FR4**: Provide interface for architects to input component-NFR relationship scores
- **FR5**: Calculate overall architecture quality scores

## Version Management & Comparison

- **FR6**: Store and manage historical versions of architectural models
- **FR7**: Perform diff analysis between architectural diagram versions
- **FR8**: Compare quality attribute scores across different model versions
- **FR9**: Track improvements and regressions in architectural quality over time

## User Interface & Reporting

- **FR10**: Web-based application accessible through standard browsers
- **FR11**: Display visual diffs highlighting changes between architectural versions
- **FR12**: Generate evaluation reports
