### Formulated Hypotheses

#### Hypothesis 1: Evaluation Cycle Completion (North Star)

**We believe that** the automated matrix population feature **for**
software architects, students, and researchers **will result in** at least
70% of users successfully completing a full evaluation cycle (upload
PlantUML → auto-populated matrix → score adjustments → save version)
**when** they upload a valid PlantUML component diagram **because**
automation reduces manual effort and eliminates need to manually map
components to NFRs, making evaluation process accessible and efficient.

**Primary Indicator of Value (North Star)**: This is our North Star
metric because it directly measures core value proposition, captures
end-to-end user success, validates that tool solves the real problem, and
combines technical capability, usability, and value delivery.

#### Hypothesis 2: Workflow Efficiency

**We believe that** the integrated evaluation workflow (upload →
auto-populate → score → compare) **for** architecture practitioners
**will result in** users completing the core workflow in under 5 minutes
(including version comparison) **when** they have a valid PlantUML
diagram ready **because** automation eliminates manual matrix population,
reduces cognitive load, and provides immediate visual feedback.

#### Hypothesis 3: User Retention

**We believe that** the version comparison and evolution tracking features
**for** students and researchers working on architecture projects **will
result in** at least 40% of first-time users returning within 7 days to
create or compare additional architecture versions **because** architecture
evaluation is iterative, and ability to track evolution provides ongoing
value.

For the Hypothesis Driven Development preparation, the section was added later during the sprint. We didn't notice it
until very late, we discussed it with course instructor and will be pushing it to the next sprint.
