## Summary

We successfully implemented diff visualization in both frontend and backend thus finishing the core requirements provided
by the customer. The customer expressed that it would be better to have the diff visuals on a diagram for better user experience.
 We discussed the analytics part and how are we gonna move forward in collecting the metrics to have actual data to use in
  HDD approach. We got that we should provide a token for the customer to share with other users and using this token
   we can collect the data needed for initial evaluation in HDD.

## Action Points

- Provide tokens distribution for collecting metrics.
- Reduce the complexity of the interface.
- Provide a runnable verion to the customer (using docker compose) with the token.
- Collect the metrics.
- Use the data in Hypothesis Driven Development (HDD).
- Develop reports generation.
