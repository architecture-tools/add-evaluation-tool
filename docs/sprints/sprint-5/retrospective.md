# Sprint 5 Retrospective

## What went well?

1. Successful Analytics Implementation: The team effectively set up Grafana Cloud and connected our system to visualize
 telemetry data, enabling data-driven insights into system performance.

2. Diagram Diff Functionality Completion: We successfully implemented both frontend and backend components for diagram
 comparison, meeting a key client requirement.

3. MVP Release Achievement: Successfully created and documented the first MVP release, marking a significant milestone
 in our project development.

4. Effective Observability Setup: Successfully instrumented the system with monitoring, diagnostics, and alerting capabilities.

## What problems did we encounter?

### Problem 1: Changing Requirements of assignment

- Description: Unexpected changes in assignment requirements during the sprint caused re-prioritization and
 adjustment of planned work.
- Root Cause: External factors beyond team control which led to disturbance in organization of this week's sprint.
- Solution: We adapted quickly by re-evaluating our backlog and focusing on the highest priority tasks,
 while maintaining communication among team members for syncronization.

### Problem 2: Insufficient Time for HDD

- Description: We didn't notice the addition of preparation to HDD task section until later in the sprint.
- Root Cause: Addition of tasks to assignment. We were conflicted between implementing features and conducting proper
 HDD analysis.
- Solution: We prioritized feature implementation to meet sprint goal and delegated HDD to next sprint.

### Problem 3: Client Expectations for Graph Diff

- Description: The client requested to see visual differences in PlantUML diagrams, instead of textual feedback.
- Root Cause: The client sees it better for user experience for the main user (designer) especially with large projects.
- Solution: We focused on implementing the diagram diff functionality as a priority and ensured both backend endpoints
 and frontend visualization were properly integrated, we will go further to improve it in the next sprint.

## Plan for Improvement

### High Impact

1. Discuss changing of assignment requirements with course instructors and see what can be done as a solution or
if we find them overwhelmingly changing to postpone them to later sprints.

2. Prepare for HDD and gathering of data to make informed decisions based on it.

### Medium Impact

1. Improve Time Management with regards to changes in plan of a sprint.

### Low Impact

1. Write course improvements for better preparation in the next iterations.
