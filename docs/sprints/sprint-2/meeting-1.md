## Summary

This meeting was a progress review and planning session for the ongoing sprint. The primary focus was on demonstrating the current prototype and gathering detailed feedback on functionality and future direction.

## Action Points

- Implement the functionality to upload a new PlantUML file and have the UI update the list of components (columns), highlighting new additions (in green) and removed components (in red) compared to the previous version.
- Ensure that the table is scrollable to handle many components.
- When a new version is uploaded, pre-populate grades from the previous version for existing components. New components should be left ungraded for the user to fill in.
- Continue work on the rest of the frontend of the project.
- Consider and provide feedback on the long-term vision for handling architectures with a large number of components (a non-table view, element-by-element grading with diagram highlighting).


### Next Steps & Expectations
We has a clear set of deliverables for the next iteration, centered on making the table dynamic and version-aware. The client's feedback on the long-term UI vision was noted for future sprint planning beyond the immediate MVP.
