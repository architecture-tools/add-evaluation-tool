# Sprint 2 Retrospective

## What went well?
1.  Excellent Cross-functional Collaboration: There was great collaboration between frontend and backend developers. We were able to develop the first draft before the meeting with client.
2.  Client Engagement & Clear Feedback: The client actively participated in the meeting and provided clear, actionable feedback on the prototype's functionality and future direction.
3.  Technical Adaptability: The team successfully adapted to a key requirement change (the shift to a -1/0/+1 grading scale) by reworking the calculation logic mid-sprint.

### What problems did we encounter?
1.  Problem: Late Requirement Clarification on User Flow
    - Description: The core user flow for handling model versions and comparisons was not fully understood until the demo meeting, requiring significant clarification.
    - Root Cause: Initial user stories lacked sufficient detail on the version comparison workflow, leading to incorrect assumptions about the desired process.
    - Solution: The team used the meeting to gather detailed requirements directly from the client, creating clarity for the next sprint.
2. Problem: Documentation Overload
    - Description: we experienced burnout from excessive documentation requirements, including meeting notes, technical specifications, and process documentation, which reduced time available for actual development work.
    - Root Cause: Assignment requirements emphasize comprehensive documentation, leading to parallel tracking of both development work and extensive documentation along with keeping up with other coursework.
    - Solution: We raised the issue with course instructors and addressed it during last lecture and now waiting for announcment of adjustments.

## Plan for Improvement

### High Impact
1.  Establish a "Definition of Ready": Create a checklist for user stories to ensure they have clear, specific acceptance criteria and that all major functional questions are answered before the sprint begins. This will help prevent late discoveries about user workflows.

### Medium Impact
2.  Conduct Requirement Kick-offs for Complex Features: For features involving complex user interactions (like version comparison), hold brief collaborative sessions with the client before development to clarify workflows and acceptance criteria.

### Low Impact
3.  Conduct team meetings specifically for documentation to ease the process and collect info that can be refined later easily.
