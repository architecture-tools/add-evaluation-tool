## Summary

We need to develop a tool (probably a web app) that integrates with a
modeling language (PlantUML) and extracts a model's architectural
components and combines it with predefined non-functional requirements
to create an evaluation matrix. Architects use this matrix to input
scores reflecting the relation between NFRs and components and then we
use these scores to calculate overall architecture score that
represents this model. We should also have history of previous versions
and use them to compare to current one and see how changes affect
quality attributes, and the overall score to evaluate improvements and
regressions. Additionally, the tool should provide visual diffs of
architectural diagrams to highlight changes between version, aiding
understanding beyond textual diffs.
