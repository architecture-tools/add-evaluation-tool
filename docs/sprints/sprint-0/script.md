## Script Structure

1. Introduction and getting aquainted.
2. Meeting questions:
    - Can we record the meeting?
    - Can you describe some typical scenarios (use cases) in which the tool will be used?   (open ended question but it gives client feeling that we are not prepared)
    - What kind of feedback or results do you expect to get from the tool?
    - What form is expected for implementation? As a console utility? As a GUI app? As a web app?
    - Which non-functional requirements (quality attributes) are the most important to include in the evaluation matrix? Or it has to be dynamic? 
    - What should a single cell in this matrix contain? (a score from 1-5, a simple checkmark?)
    - How detailed should the component specifications be in PlantUML? Like services level, class level, data flow level?
    - How do you want the tool to show differences between architecture versions? (e.g., side-by-side visual diff, textual diff)
    - Should the tool have a history of versions or we will feed it the 2 versions for comparison?
    - Should the tool generate reports or summaries for each evaluation?
    - What platforms and operating systems must the tool support?

Improvements for next interviews:
- Don't use all close-ended questions to give client a chance to describe their experience in detail.
- Don't use all these complicated technical terms for client
