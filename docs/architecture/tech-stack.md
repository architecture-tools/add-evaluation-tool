## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Dart + Flutter Web**: Single codebase for web UI with fast iteration and robust widget system; built‑in Material 3 support aligns with modern UX needs.
- **http (Dart package)**: Lightweight HTTP client for straightforward REST calls to the backend.
- **Nginx (static hosting & SPA routing)**: Serves compiled Flutter assets efficiently and handles client‑side routing with `try_files`; also proxies API requests to the backend.

### Backend
- **Python 3.11**: Modern, stable runtime with wide ecosystem and team familiarity.
- **FastAPI**: High‑performance async web framework with type hints, automatic OpenAPI generation, and clear developer experience.
- **Uvicorn (ASGI server)**: Production‑grade async server well‑suited for FastAPI.
- **Pydantic v2**: Typed data validation and serialization for request/response models.

### API & Contract
- **OpenAPI (auto‑generated by FastAPI)**: Up‑to‑date interactive API docs at `/docs` with minimal extra work.
- **JSON over HTTP**: Simple, widely supported format for client‑server communication.

### Database & Storage
- PostgreSQL for reliability, transactions, and broad tooling support.

### Containerization & Orchestration
- **Docker**: Reproducible environments for both backend and frontend.
- **Docker Compose**: Simple local orchestration for multi‑service setup (frontend + backend).

### Testing & Quality
- **Backend: pytest**: Widely used, expressive testing framework for Python.
- **Backend: ruff + mypy**: Fast linting and consistent formatting to maintain code quality.
- **Frontend: flutter_test + flutter_lints**: Built‑in testing and lint rules to keep UI code reliable and idiomatic.

### Documentation & Diagramming
- **Markdown (docs/)**: Plain‑text documentation that’s easy to review and version.
- **PlantUML**: Standardized component/spec diagrams aligned with the project’s architecture focus.
- **Mermaid**: Lightweight sequence/context diagrams embedded in Markdown for quick iterations.

### Security & Networking
- **Nginx reverse proxy**: Fronts the web app and proxies `/api` to the backend.
- **CORS configuration**: Explicit origins in production to restrict browser access.
- **Future: HTTPS termination**: TLS handled by the reverse proxy or platform provider in production.

### CI/CD (Planned)
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated lint/build/test for backend and frontend; container image builds for repeatable deployments.
