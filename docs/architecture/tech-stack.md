## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Dart + Flutter Web**: Single codebase for web UI with fast iteration and robust widget system; built‑in Material 3 support aligns with modern UX needs.
- **http (Dart package)**: Lightweight HTTP client for straightforward REST calls to the backend.
- **Nginx (static hosting & SPA routing)**: Serves compiled Flutter assets efficiently and handles client‑side routing with `try_files`; also proxies API requests to the backend.

### Backend
- **Python 3.11**: Modern, stable runtime with wide ecosystem and team familiarity.
- **FastAPI**: High‑performance async web framework with type hints, automatic OpenAPI generation, and clear developer experience.
- **Uvicorn (ASGI server)**: Production‑grade async server well‑suited for FastAPI.
- **Pydantic v2**: Typed data validation and serialization for request/response models.

### API & Contract
- **OpenAPI (auto‑generated by FastAPI)**: Up‑to‑date interactive API docs at `/docs` with minimal extra work.
- **JSON over HTTP**: Simple, widely supported format for client‑server communication.

### Database & Storage
- PostgreSQL for reliability, transactions, and broad tooling support.

### Containerization & Orchestration
- **Docker**: Reproducible environments for both backend and frontend.
- **Docker Compose**: Simple local orchestration for multi‑service setup (frontend + backend).

### Testing & Quality
- **Backend: pytest**: Widely used, expressive testing framework for Python.
- **Backend: ruff + mypy**: Fast linting and consistent formatting to maintain code quality.
- **Frontend: flutter_test + flutter_lints**: Built‑in testing and lint rules to keep UI code reliable and idiomatic.

## Testing
We standardized on `pytest` with the `pytest-cov` plugin for backend unit testing. Pytest already underpins our existing tests, offers first-class fixtures/monkeypatching for FastAPI services, and integrates seamlessly with Poetry. The pytest-cov plugin layers in coverage reporting and lets us gate per-module thresholds without bolting on another runner, so we get a single, fast command for both correctness and coverage validation.

## Static analysis
- **Ruff (Python linter + formatter)**: One tool enforces the Python style guide (`ruff format --check`) and runs lint rules in a single, ultra-fast pass, so contributors don’t have to juggle black/isort/flake8 separately.
- **Mypy (Python type checker)**: Catches interface mismatches and optional/None bugs in our dynamically typed backend before runtime, which is critical for service stability.
- **Dart formatter**: `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed` keeps the Flutter widget tree readable and guarantees identical whitespace regardless of the contributor’s IDE.
- **Dart analyzer**: `dart analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings` catches UI/layout regressions and ensures null-safety issues never reach a device build.
- **markdownlint-cli2**: Enforces consistent Markdown headings, tables, and fenced blocks so architecture docs stay reviewable even as they scale.
- **Lychee link checker**: Automated dead-link detection prevents stale references in docs/ and README, which is vital for contributors onboarding through documentation first.

### Documentation & Diagramming
- **Markdown (docs/)**: Plain‑text documentation that’s easy to review and version.
- **PlantUML**: Standardized component/spec diagrams aligned with the project’s architecture focus.
- **Mermaid**: Lightweight sequence/context diagrams embedded in Markdown for quick iterations.

### Security & Networking
- **Nginx reverse proxy**: Fronts the web app and proxies `/api` to the backend.
- **CORS configuration**: Explicit origins in production to restrict browser access.
- **Future: HTTPS termination**: TLS handled by the reverse proxy or platform provider in production.

### CI/CD (Planned)
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated lint/build/test for backend and frontend; container image builds for repeatable deployments.
